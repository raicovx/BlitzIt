    <string name="faq_body_3_3">These supports and services must meet certain criteria based on section 32 of the <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.au/Details/C2013A00020">National Disability Insurance Scheme Act 2013 (NDIS Act).</a></string>
    <string name="faq_header_3">What is \'Reasonable and Necessary\'?</string>
    <string name="faq_body_3_1">The NDIS provides funding to participants for support and services aimed at increasing their independence, inclusion, and social and economic participation.</string>
    <string name="faq_body_3_2">Reasonable and necessary is a term used to determine what kind of funded support you might need. Simply put - reasonable is something that is considered fair, and necessary is something that you need because of your disability. This can be very confusing as everyone interprets differently.</string>
    <string name="faq_header_4">What Types of Plan Reviews are available?</string>
    <string name="faq_body_4_1">There are several types of plan reviews available that you should know about. Each one has a specific purpose, which you can learn from your Blitzit administrators:.\n\n✔️ Scheduled review (or often referred to as annual review)\n\n✔️ Plan extension (also known as rollover plan or interim plan)\n\n✔️ Plan reset\n\n✔️ Light touch review (otherwise known as administrative review)\n\n✔️ Review of a reviewable decision (RORD or internal review)\n\n✔️ AAT appeal (if a RORD has been declined)\n\n✔️ Change of circumstances review. \n\nWhilst it can be overwhelming, we’re here to make the complex processes easier. If you want to get your plan managed to support you in your reviews, get in touch with us at 1300 966 119 or hello@blitzit.com.au.</string>
    <string name="faq_header_5">What is a service agreement?</string>
    <string name="faq_body_5_1">The NDIA recommends having a written service agreement so participants and providers are clear about what each party has agreed to.</string>
    <string name="faq_body_5_2">Service agreements help make sure each party is clear about the supports being provided, the cost of supports, the responsibilities of your providers, how long the agreement is and the dispute resolution process. </string>
    <string name="faq_body_5_3">For more advice on making the most out of your budget, book a no-obligation call with Blitzit today. Give us a ring at 1300 966 119 or email hello@blitzit.com.au.</string>
    <string name="faq_body_6_1">If, as a participant or nominee/carer, you have paid for an item or service that is considered reasonable and necessary for your disability, you can be reimbursed by choosing any of the following options:</string>

    <string name="faq_header_7">What is funded by the NDIS?</string>
    <string name="faq_body_7_1">NDIS covers funding for the following categories. See <a href="https://www.blitzit.com.au/understanding-your-ndis-plan#">Understanding Your NDIS Plan</a> for a broad overview on what’s covered under funded support.</string>
    <string name="faq_body_7_2">• Assistance with daily life (Core) \n\n• Transport (Core) \n\n• Consumables (Core) \n\n• Assistance with social community and civic participation (Core) \n\n• Assistive technology \n\n• Home modifications and specialist disability accommodation \n\n• Support coordination \n\n• Increased social and community participation \n\n• Improved daily living \n\n• Improved relationships \n\n• Improved learning \n\n• Improved health and wellbeing \n\n• Improved life choices \n\n• Finding and keeping a job \n\n• Improved living arrangements</string>
    <string name="faq_body_7_3">We work closely with many different service providers that can support your individual needs and situation. We may be able to suggest providers in your local area – simply <a href="https://www.blitzit.com.au/contact">contact us</a> to find out more.</string>
    <string name="faq_header_8">Can I change my providers if I am not happy with their service?</string>
    <string name="faq_body_8">Of course! Participants can choose to change to a different provider at any time. Contact us and we can help answer questions you may have on changing providers.</string>
    <string name="faq_body_3_4">The NDIS may ask you to determine how you justify purchasing products, services and items as reasonable and necessary from your NDIS funds, it is important to provide them with as much evidence as you can to confirm the reasoning for your choice.\n\nWhen you attend your NDIS planning meeting, the NDIA Planner or Local Area Coordinator or ECIC will collect information about you to build your plan to include supports that NDIS considers are reasonable and necessary to your situation and help you pursue your goals and aspirations. \n\nYour NDIS Planner determines reasonable and necessary as everyone\'s situation, disability and goals are different this means that what NDIS considers reasonable and necessary for you will be different for someone else and likewise, what they consider reasonable and necessary to someone else will be different to you. \n\nThis checklist and guide will assist you to break down the criteria that the NDIS uses when determining if a support, product or service you\'re seeking meets the definition NDIS considers to be reasonable and necessary to your personal situation.</string>
    <string name="faq_body_3_5">For a support to be reasonable and necessary, it should:\n\n• Relate to your disability\n\n• Help you pursue your goals and aspirations\n\n• Increase your independence\n\n• Increase your community, social and workplace involvement\n\n• Be considered value for money (this is especially true if the support is priced above the NDIS Price Guide)\n\n• Be effective and work for your needs\n\n• Take into account your current formal and informal supports\n\nIf you answered yes to all of the questions then you may be able to make the purchase using your NDIS funds.\n\nThere are some things that may not be considered as ‘reasonable and necessary’, like:\n\n• Day-to-day living costs that are not related to your disability support needs\n\n• Supports that can reasonably be given by a family member, carer, or the wider community\n\n• Supports already funded by other areas of government</string>
    <string name="faq_body_5_6">What if I am still unsure ?</string>
    <string name="faq_body_5_7">To discuss your individual circumstances and better understand the NDIS <a href="https://www.blitzit.com.au/contact">contact</a> our team of expert plan managers at hello@blitzit.com.au or call us for a chat on 1300 966 119.</string>
